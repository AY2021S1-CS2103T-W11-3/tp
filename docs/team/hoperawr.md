## Project: My Fitness Buddy

My Fitness Buddy is My Fitness Buddy is a desktop application that helps PES B pending recruits keep track of their
 overall change in fitness level by allowing them to add daily records of their weight and calorie input/output.  
           
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Update Profile
  * What it does: allows the user to update their profile after creation.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when creating their profile and be allowed to edit it.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Storage able to handle new classes

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Handled the entire storage system and storage test cases which included the creation of 5 new classes to handle 
  the new and constantly changing features of the application (Pull requests [\#76](), [\#133](), [\#159]())

  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage.
